    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before i developed the console-based Black Jack, i tried developing a slightly simpler game, also console based: Tic-Tac-Toe. Here are the problem statements for both the apps:</p>

<h2 id="problem-statement-for-tic-tac-toe:">Problem Statement for Tic-Tac-Toe:</h2>

<p>On an empty board of 3x3 squares, a player and the computer (or another player) pick empty squares to put their <code>X</code> or <code>O</code> (symbols) in. The first one to have their symbols in a row (or column or diagonal) of 3 wins.</p>

<h3 id="extracted-nouns:">Extracted Nouns:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Board</li>
<li>Square( or Position )</li>
<li>Player (this would also address the other player/computer?)</li>
<li>Game (that would be the engine)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: The Tic-Tac-Toe code can be a perfect foundation for a &quot;connect-4&quot; game!
  &#8230; or even a &#39;expandable&#39; version of Tic-Tac-Toe (4x4, 5x5, etc.)!!</p>

<h2 id="problem-statement-for-blackjack:">Problem Statement for BlackJack:</h2>

<p>BlackJack is a card game played between a dealer and player(s). The dealer starts out with dealing 2 cards from a deck to each player. A player wins if he/she hits a BlackJack (score of 21), unless the dealer has also hit a BlackJack. If neither have hit a BlackJack, player can choose to hit (get dealt another card) till he/she decides to stop/stay, scores 21, or loses (scores more than 21). If the player decides to stay (i.e. &lt; 21), next player chooses to hit or stay. If no player hits a BlackJack, dealer can choose to hit (draw one card at a time) till he/she loses (&gt;21), reaches 17, or wins (hits BlackJack). If dealer reaches anywhere between (&gt;=) 17 and (&lt;) 21, the highest scorer wins.</p>

<ul>
<li>Modules can reference public instance methods of the class, for e.g.</li>
</ul>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Modules Referencing Instance Methods</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Walkable</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">walk</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> is walking&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Class</span> <span class="no">Dog</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">attr_accessor</span> <span class="ss">:name</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Walkable</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>The above will work ONLY if the class that implements the module Walkable has a public method <code>name</code> (which is a getter in this case).
<em>It is a good practice to put a comment to that effect where the module is defined.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Only two things evaluate to the boolean <code>false</code> in Ruby, they are a null object <code>nil</code> and <code>false</code></p></li>
<li><p>Every expression returns something in Ruby.
The return value is shown after an hash-rocket sign <code>=&gt;</code> in an IRB session after executing a
line of code.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s a good idea to just return a string from a method and then using <code>puts</code> on the method call to display the desired string rather than doing a <code>puts</code> in the method itself.</p></li>
</ul>

 <li><a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1485114/ruby-constructors-and-exceptions'>Raising exceptions during object instansiation</a></li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A good way to start developing/design an OO application is following the steps below:

<ol>
<li>Write the problem statement for the application</li>
<li>Extract nouns from the problem statement: can be good indicators for required classes</li>
<li>Extract verbs and associate them with the nouns: can be good indicators of required methods and responsibilities</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

    <id>http://ppj.github.io/blog/2014/08/18/how-to-start-writing-a-procedural-program</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have starter trouble&#8230; always. I either spend way too much time &#39;planning&#39; and &#39;collecting information&#39; when i want to start something new, or, the other extreme (but less often), just dive right into it and then suffer due to under preparation.</p>

<p>The fundamental technique i learnt during the first course in the first <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/">TeaLeaf</a> course on Ruby basics was how to start writing a program. In other words, how much preparation is just enough to start writing a procedural program.</p>

<p>A quick side-note: Although, procedural programming is (almost) a thing of the past, and all for the right reasons, it is still a great way to start learning programming IMO. The primary reason, i believe, is our brains are wired to think sequentially or serially: first do this, then get the result, then do that&#8230; and so on. At least mine is.</p>

<p>So to get over that starting trouble, the technique to start writing a program that best helped me is writing psuedo-code. &quot;Pseudo&quot; as in made up syntax, not bother about whether it will run, because it will not! The psuedo-code is almost plain English, or very close to it. Just enough to guide you in writing the actual code.</p>

<p>Just jot down the logical steps (loops, conditionals, operations) you think are required to solve the programming problem. One rule i stuck to when doing this exercise is: use consistent indentation for readability.</p>

<p>As an example, this is the psuedo code i wrote for a console-based player-vs-computer Tic-Tac-Toe game:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Start with an empty 3x3 board
</span><span class='line'>until board full or winner
</span><span class='line'>  ask player to chose empty square to mark his/her 'X'
</span><span class='line'>  display board
</span><span class='line'>  if player won?
</span><span class='line'>    announce winner and end game
</span><span class='line'>  else if board full?
</span><span class='line'>    end game
</span><span class='line'>  else
</span><span class='line'>    generate a random number and let the computer choose an empty square to mark its 'O'
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>  display board
</span><span class='line'>  if computer won
</span><span class='line'>    announce winner and end game
</span><span class='line'>  elsif board full?
</span><span class='line'>    end game
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<div>Some features of this technique are:</div>

<ul>
<li>it highlights my logic of developing a solution</li>
<li>it helps to keep focus on the current coding task</li>
<li>it helps to bring focus back to the next coding task if the previous one took longer than normal for whatever reasons (new language, syntactical errors)</li>
<li>it need not be perfect (or updated all the time for small changes in the actual implementation)</li>
<li>The final Ruby code for this simple application (if it can be called that!) can be found <a href="https://github.com/ppj/tealeaf1_Lesson1/blob/master/tic_tac_toe.rb">here</a> </li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a quick reference guide for using ‘pry’ gem for debugging Ruby code.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h3 class='no_extra_new_line'>Installation:</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>gem list pry</code>: lists whether it is already installed<br></li>
<li><code>gem install pry</code>: installs the pry gem</li>
</ul>

<h3 class='no_extra_new_line'>Use:</h3>

<ol>
<li><code>require &#39;pry&#39;</code>

<ul>
<li>insert the above line at the top of the ruby file you intend to debug</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>binding.pry</code>

<ul>
<li>insert the above line to stop execution at a particular point in the code</li>
<li>insert this after the line where you want to pause the program execution</li>
</ul></li>
<li>run the program

<ul>
<li>type the debugging stuff (variable names, method names etc.) once the program pauses</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>step</code>

<ul>
<li>type ‘step’ to go to the next line</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ctrl+D

<ul>
<li>use the above key combo to move to the next ‘binding.pry’ statement in the program</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://knomedia.github.io/blog/2013/01/21/debugging-ruby-with-pry">Here’s a good screen cast</a> describing the debugging features of Pry.</p>

<p>However, debugging is just one of the many things that can be done using Pry. One other main feature is replacing IRB. A good reference page (with screen-casts and all) can be found <a href="http://pryrepl.org/">here</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the title suggests&#8230;</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Some would say i am too late to jump on the bandwagon. In my defense, i am lazy!</p>

<p>What made me start writing a blog is this Ruby (and Rails) programming course series from <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/">TeaLeaf</a>. At the time of writing this, I am almost about to finish the first of the three courses.</p>

<p>So, at least to start with, i will be writing mostly about my learnings during the course(s) and related stuff, posting links to websites, screen-casts that i find interesting, and of course, my 2 cents about the related stuff.</p>

<p>As i start out, the primary aim for this blog would be to serve me (and other similarly-abled people) as a reference to the tips/tricks i would be learning and discovering as i progress. Nothing more to that, i guess. But who knows, it might have a bit of digression every once in a while.</p>
