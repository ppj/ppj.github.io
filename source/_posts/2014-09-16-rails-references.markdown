I just started the [second](http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum#!rails) of the 3 [TeaLeaf](http://www.gotealeaf.com/) courses for back-end web-application development using Ruby on Rails.

<!-- more -->

The last exercise in Course 1 was an introduction to web-app development in Ruby using the Sinatra framework. Rails, as I understand so far, is a much more intense framework as compared to Sinatra. So, it has a much steeper learning curve. All the more true, for a web-app newbie.

<div>Here, I have listed some resources to start learning and revising my Rails knowledge:</div>
1. <div><a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html'>The getting started guide</a>: This is great for as a first-time Rails tutorial... just power through as many things will not make much sense! This page has links to more detailed descriptions of the concepts; some important ones are:</div>
  - [Rails Database Migrations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html)
  - [Layouts And Rendering In Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html)
  - [Active Record Associations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html)

2. [The Rails Tutorial (Book)](https://www.railstutorial.org/book): A good comprehensive tutorial for beginners and also to refresh the Rails basics!
