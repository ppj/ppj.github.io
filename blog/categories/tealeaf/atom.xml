    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just started the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum#!rails">second</a> of the 3 <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/">TeaLeaf</a> courses for back-end web-application development using Ruby on Rails.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The last exercise in Course 1 was an introduction to web-app development in Ruby using the Sinatra framework. Rails, as I understand so far, is a much more intense framework as compared to Sinatra. So, it has a much steeper learning curve. All the more true, for a web-app newbie.</p>

<p>Listed below are some of the key notes i made as i went through the precourse material and attempted the exercises.</p>

<h3 class='no_extra_new_line'>Major Takeaways:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The first few things to look at in a pre-existing Rails app&#39;s code

<ul>
<li>.README.markdown</li>
<li>./Gemfile: Gives an idea of the complexity of the app based on the variety of gems it depends on</li>
<li>./config/routes.rb: Has code to generate various routes the app has</li>
<li>use <code>rake routes</code> or <APP_HOMEPAGE>\rails\info route to list various routes</li>
<li>./config/database.yml: database related info </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rails has a lot of &quot;magic&quot; going on in the background owing mainly to its conventions (expectations and auto creation of files &amp; code based on a single line of code / shell command)</li>
<li>For the same reason, lot of hands-on practice would be needed to get used to all (or most) things going on in rails, ranging from folder &amp; file structure to more advanced features</li>
<li><code>rails generate ...</code> should be used sparingly as it can be confusing and/or redundant (generates lot of unnecessary files/code)</li>
<li>no data from the database is actually pushed to Git (.gitignore file is set to ignore the default db&#39;s &#39;.sqlite3&#39; files for git operations)

<ul>
<li>the migration file and schema.rb which is modified by the <code>rake db:migrate</code> command is what goes into the repository</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 class='no_extra_new_line'>Learning Resources:</h3>

<ol>
<li><div><a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html'>The getting started guide</a>: This is pretty good as a first-time Rails tutorial&#8230; i just powered through as many questions were raised following the steps listed! The page has links to more detailed descriptions of the concepts; some important ones are:</div>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html">Rails Database Migrations</a></li>

</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book">The Rails Tutorial (Book)</a>: This looks like a good comprehensive tutorial and i plan to use it to refresh my Rails knowledge a while after i finish the course!</li>
