<!-- more -->

<p>Some would say i am too late to jump on the bandwagon. In my defense, i am lazy!</p>

<p>What made me start writing a blog is this Ruby (and Rails) programming course series from <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/">TeaLeaf</a>. At the time of writing this, I am almost about to finish the first of the three courses.</p>

<p>So, at least to start with, i will be writing mostly about my learnings during the course(s) and related stuff, posting links to websites, screen-casts that i find interesting, and of course, my 2 cents about the related stuff.</p>

<p>As i start out, the primary aim for this blog would be to serve me (and other similarly-abled people) as a reference to the tips/tricks i would be learning and discovering as i progress. Nothing more to that, i guess. But who knows, it might have a bit of digression every once in a while.</p>
